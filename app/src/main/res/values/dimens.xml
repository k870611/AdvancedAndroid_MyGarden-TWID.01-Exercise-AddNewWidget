<!--TODO (5):Widget Margins
Since Android API 14 and onwards, Android automatically includes margins between widgets as they appear on the user's home screen.
 A new "values-v14" folder contains a copy of that file which targets API levels from 14 onwards, however the margin value here is set to 0dp.-->
